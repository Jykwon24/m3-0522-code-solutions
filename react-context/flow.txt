User sign up
  - The Auth-Form component renders the input elements for the user name and the
  password along with an anchor tag and the submit button for the form. Within
  the form component there are a few methods used to handle changes to the form's
  state which is an object containing properties of username and password. Both
  properties are set to an initial value of an empty string.
